## Summary

You've now used Git to create a repository
and made some commits on a feature branch.
Your repository will look something like this:

```mermaid
---
config:
  gitGraph:
    showCommitLabel: false
---
    gitGraph
        accDescr {A git graph showing the root-commit on the main branch and a new forecast branch with five commits.}
        commit id: 'Initial commit'
        branch forecast
        commit id: 'Create a md file with the forecast'
        commit id: 'Add tomorrows forecast to forecast.md'
        commit id: 'Modify the forecast to add a chance of Sun'
        commit id: 'Add in the temperature to the forecast and create the weather atlas file'
        commit id: 'Ignore png files and the data folder'
```

Your repo may have a different number of commits on the forecast branch
depending on which challenge exercises you have completed.
You can find short summaries of all the new commands
you've learnt on the Key Points page.
