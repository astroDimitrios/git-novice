::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Configure your GitHub profile and settings.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- How do I edit my GitHub profile?
- How do I change my notification preferences?
- How do I change my organisation membership visibility,
  and team memberships?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

In this section we will look at configuring some optional GitHub
settings on both a GitHub wide and repository level. 

## Profile Settings

You access your profile settings by navigating to:
[https://github.com/settings/profile](https://github.com/settings/profile)

Working down the page:

1. Set your preferred name. This helps collaborators find you on GitHub.
2. Set a public email, this also helps collaborators find your profile.
   To keep your email address private click on **email settings**,
   then tick the **Keep my email addresses private** checkbox.
3. Set your pronouns.
4. If you have a professional website you can add a link to the URL section.
5. If you have an [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) you can link your GitHub
   profile to your ID.
6. If you would like to display your organisational affiliation add
   `@<organisation-name>` to the Company section.

You can also set a profile picture on this page.
Click on the green **Update profile** button when you have
finished making changes.

You can also make profile changes directly from your profile
by clicking on the **Edit profile** button.

## Configuring Notifications

To configure general notification settings navigate to:
[https://github.com/settings/notifications](https://github.com/settings/notifications)

Here you can choose a default email for notifications,
and set up **Custom routing**.
Custom routing allows you to specify different emails
for each organisation you are a member of.

In the **Subscriptions** section you can decide
whether to receive notifications via GitHub, email, or both.

### Repository Notifications

You can customise notifications on a repository level.
Since you created the `weather` repository you are
automatically watching **All Activity**.
Click on the **Unwatch** dropdown to change your notification settings.

The same dropdown will display **Watch** on repositories
that do not belong to you.

## Organisation Membership

If you are a member of an organisation you can make your membership
of the organisation public or private by navigating to:
`https://github.com/orgs/<organisation-name>/people`

Search for your name and click on the right hand dropdown
to change your organisation visibility.

The default visibility setting will depend on your organisation.
If you set the visibility to public your membership will appear
on your profile, `https://github.com/<your-username>/`,
near the bottom left of the screen.

## Teams Membership

One across from the People settings are the Teams settings:
`https://github.com/orgs/<organisation-name>/teams`.
You can leave, request to join, or if you are an admin add members
to your GitHub team here.
[Teams](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams)
let you manage access to repositories
for a group of people all at once.
Some organisations restrict the creation of GitHub teams to central admins.
