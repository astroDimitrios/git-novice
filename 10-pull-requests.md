- Make a pull request and describe what they are useful for

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- What are pull requests for?
- How can I make a pull request?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Pull requests are a great way to collaborate with others using GitHub. Instead of making changes directly to a repository you can suggest changes to a repository using a pull request.

Pull requests are where your changes go through the 
vital steps of code and science review.
Some of these code and science checks can be completely
automated using pull requests (PRs).
This helps speed up the review process and 
reduce the chance of human error when checking new code.

## Creating a Pull Request

In the last episode on branches we developed a change 
on the `seasonal-forecast` branch.
Let's use a PR to merge these changes back into the `main` branch.
Make sure you are still on the `seasonal-forecast` branch:

```bash
$ git switch seasonal-forecast
```

Now we can publish these changes to GitHub:

```bash
$ git push
```

Navigate to your `weather` GitHub repo. 
You should see a notification appear with the text
**`seasonal-forecast` had recent pushes**.

![](fig/github_create_pr.png){alt='A screenshot of the weather repo showing the notification prompting us to Compare & pull request for the seasonal-forecast branch.'}

Click on the green **Compare & pull request** button.

![](fig/github_create_pr_2.png){alt='A screenshot of the weather repo showing the creation of a pull request for the seasonal-forecast branch changes.'}

This page lets us create a new pull request from the
`seasonal-forecast` branch.
The title has been autofilled with the message of the last commit.
You can see all the commits on the branch at the bottom of this page.

Make sure the title and description are clear.
Then press the green **Create pull request** button.

### Draft Pull Requests

If your changes are not ready for review yet you can 
mark the pull request as a draft:

![](fig/github_draft_pr.png){alt='A screenshot showing the dropdown to swap from a normal pull request to a creating a draft pull request.'}

Draft pull requests can't be merged and code reviewers
aren't automatically assigned.

:::

![](fig/github_pr.png){alt='A screenshot showing an open pull request on the weather repo.'}

Notice we've now moved to the **Pull Requests** tab.
This is PR **#1** and underneath the title we see:

> wants to merge 1 commit into `main` from `seasonal-forecast`

If you need to change the title or the branch you're merging into,
in this case `main`, click on the **edit** button 
to the far right of the title.

The PR has four tabs below the title section:

- **Conversation** is where code and science reviews occur
- **Commits** shows all the commits we want to merge
- **Checks** shows the output from any automated code and science checks
- **Files Changed** shows a diff (difference) between the 
  branch with your changes, `seasonal-forecast`,
  and the target branch, `main`.

At this point you should use the diff in the **Files changed** tab to check your changes.

## Rulesets

GitHub [Rulesets](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets) control how people can
interact with your repository.

When we opened our first PR we were prompted to **Require approval from specific reviewers before merging**. Click on the **Add rule** button.

This page lets us create a rule preventing anyone from committing directly
into the `main` branch.
All repositories should have some form of protection using these rulesets.
To add a rule to protect the `main` branch:

1. Enter the **Ruleset Name** `main`
2. Change the **Enforcement status** to `Active`
3. Scroll down to **Target branches**.
   Click **Add target** and select **Default branch**
   (which in our `weather` repo is `main`).
4. Scroll down to **Rules**.
   Tick the **Require a pull request before merging** option.
5. At the bottom of the page click the green **Create** button.

Now even if you commit to `main` locally you will not be able to push
those changes to GitHub.
To add changes you **MUST** open a PR and go through code and science review.

::: caution

### Private Personal Repos

Rulesets cannot be created on private repos in your personal space
unless you have a paid GitHub plan.

## Merging a Pull Request

Navigate back to your PR.
To merge the PR click on the dropdown, and select **Squash and merge**.
Squashing before merging will combine all the commits on your branch
and 'squash' them into a single new commit on the target branch, in this case `main`.
This helps keep the commit history of the `main` branch tidy and linear[^squash-merge].

![](fig/github_pr_merge.png){alt='A screenshot showing the dropdown to swap from a normal merge to a squash merge.'}

Once you've selected the squash option click on the green
**Squash and merge** button.
Edit the commit title and description if necessary.
Then click on **Confirm squash and merge**.

![](fig/github_pr_closed.png){alt='A screenshot showing a closed pull request on the weather repository.'}

The PR is now successfully merged into the `main` branch.
We can safely delete the `seasonal-forecast` branch from the GitHub repo.
Click on the **Delete branch button**.

### Updating your Local Repo

The new `seasonal-forecast.md` file is currently only on the `main` branch in GitHub.
We should pull the changes down to our local copy.
Switch to the `main` branch:

```bash
$ git switch main
```

Pull down the changes from GitHub:

```bash
$ git pull
```

```bash
remote: Enumerating objects: 4, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.

### How do I know there are Changes to Pull?

`git pull` actually runs two commands:

```bash
$ git fetch
$ git merge
```

The `git fetch` command fetches any changes on the GitHub remote.
Then `git merge` merges those changes into your local branch.

If you're not sure if there are changes to pull;
or you're not sure you want to merge the changes right away 
run `git fetch` and examine the output before running `git pull`.

Example `git fetch` output showing changes on the remote `main` branch being fetched:

```output
remote: Enumerating objects: 4, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 1), reused 2 (delta 1), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), 1010 bytes | 144.00 KiB/s, done.
From github.com:mo-ormerod/weather
   49c845c..e4bdab8  main       -> origin/main
```

### Cleaning up your Local Branches

We deleted our `seasonal-forecast` dev branch from GitHub
but we still have a local copy.
Let's tidy up by deleting it.
To see all our branches including remote GitHub branches run:

```bash
$ git branch -avv
```

```output
* main                             49c845c [origin/main] Add in a seasonal forecasts file (#1)
  seasonal-forecast                8136c6f [origin/seasonal-forecast] Add in a seasonal forecasts file
  remotes/origin/main              49c845c Add in a seasonal forecasts file (#1)
  remotes/origin/seasonal-forecast 8136c6f Add in a seasonal forecasts file
```

The first two branches are our local branches, the last two are the GitHub remotes.
To remove references to remote branches that have been deleted on GitHub run:

```bash
$ git remote prune origin
```

```ouput
Pruning origin
URL: git@github.com:mo-eormerod/weather.git
 * [pruned] origin/seasonal-forecast
```

Running `git branch -avv` again now shows:

```ouptut
* main                49c845c [origin/main] Add in a seasonal forecasts file (#1)
  seasonal-forecast   8136c6f [origin/seasonal-forecast: gone] Add in a seasonal forecasts file
  remotes/origin/main 49c845c Add in a seasonal forecasts file (#1)
```

You can see the remote reference for the `seasonal-forecast` branch
has been removed.
The second line with the local `seasonal-forecast` branch now has
`gone` in the brackets referencing the remote branch.

To delete our local branch run:

```bash
$ git branch -D seasonal-forecast
```

Running `git branch -avv` again now shows:

```output
* main                49c845c [origin/main] Add in a seasonal forecasts file (#1)
  remotes/origin/main 49c845c Add in a seasonal forecasts file (#1)
```

You've now successfully merged and tidied up after your first pull request.
Remember from now on always create a new branch and open a PR
when developing a new feature.
**NEVER** commit to the `main` branch.

## Adding in a README.md file

All repositories should have a `README` file.
The `README` file describes what is in your repository.
The [makeareadme](https://www.makeareadme.com/) website is a great
resource for `README` templates and inspiration.

Use the [makeareadme](https://www.makeareadme.com/) site or other resources
to add a `README.md` file to your repository:

1. Create a new branch with an appropriate name and switch to it
2. Create the `README.md` file
3. Add and commit the new file
4. Push the changes to GitHub
5. Open a PR on GitHub
6. Merge the PR, delete the branch on GitHub
7. Pull down the changes to your local copy
8. Tidy up your branches

:::::::::::::::: solution

1. Create a new branch with an appropriate name and switch to it

```bash
$ git switch -c add-readme
```

```output
Switched to a new branch 'add-readme'
```

2. Create the `README.md` file

```bash
$ nano README.md
$ cat README.md
```

```output
# Weather

A repo for all things weather related!
```

3. Add and commit the new file

```bash
$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m "Add in a README file"
```

```output
[add-readme aeaf804] Add in a README file
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md
```

4. Push the changes to GitHub

```bash
$ git push
```

```output
Enumerating objects: 4, done.
Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 326 bytes | 163.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), completed with 1 local object.

remote: Create a pull request for 'add-readme' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/mo-ormerod/weather/pull/new/add-readme
remote: 
To github.com:mo-ormerod/weather.git
 * [new branch]      add-readme -> add-readme
branch 'add-readme' set up to track 'origin/add-readme'.
```

5. Open a PR as shown in this very episode!
6. Merge the PR, delete the branch on GitHub
7. Pull down the changes to your local copy

Switch to main:

```bash
$ git switch main
```

If you want to check if there are changes to pull:

```bash
$ git fetch
```

```output
remote: Enumerating objects: 4, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 1), reused 2 (delta 1), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), 1010 bytes | 144.00 KiB/s, done.
From github.com:mo-ormerod/weather
   49c845c..e4bdab8  main       -> origin/main
```

Then merge the changes:

```bash
$ git pull
```

```output
Updating 49c845c..e4bdab8
Fast-forward
 README.md | 3 +++
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md
```

8. Tidy up your branches

```bash
$ git remote prune origin
```

```output
Pruning origin
URL: git@github.com:mo-ormerod/weather.git
 * [pruned] origin/add-readme
```

```bash
$ git branch -D add-readme
```

```output
Deleted branch add-readme (was aeaf804).
